{"name":"Feed monitor","tagline":"Monitor RSS feeds and send out email alerts when they're updated","body":"### Feed Monitor\r\nThis Ruby gem allows you to monitor RSS feeds and have an email alert sent out every time a feed is updated. Useful for monitoring system status updates, weather alerts, and more. I use it to monitor the status feed of services I use like Amazon AWS, Twitter API, etc., and to receive weather alerts from Environment Canada directly to my email.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use, create a script like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire 'feed_monitor'\r\n\r\nFeedMonitor.watch_feed('http://url_to_your_rss_feed/feed.xml', 'from_email@yourserver.com', 'to_email@emailaddress.com')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then run this in the cron every 5 minutes or so. The script creates a file called feedmonitor.db in the directory the script is executed. This stores date of the last update so Feed Monitor knows when a new update has been posted.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFeedMonitor was made by Brian Jones (@joshaidan) and is licenced under GPLv2.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
